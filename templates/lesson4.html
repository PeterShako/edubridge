    <h2>Lesson 4: Linking HTML Pages</h2>

    <p><strong>Linking HTML Pages</strong><br>
       HTML links or hyperlinks connect one resource on the web to another. The resource may be an image, a web page, a program, a video clip, an audio clip, an element within a web page, etc, or anything that can be hosted on the internet.</p>

    <p><strong>How to Make Links to Other Pages and Elsewhere</strong></p>
    <p>As you already know, links are a vital part of Web pages. Links allow you to move 
    smoothly from one page to another. It allows you to navigate from page to page. It also 
    enables you to get more information about a certain topic. 
    As such, there are a lot of different types of links that you should know when learning 
    HTML. Let us first concentrate on the body of your HTML document. What are these 
    link types that you should know about?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Regular or text links</li>
        <li>Image links</li>
        <li>Links to email addresses</li>
        <li>Placeholder or anchor Links</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Regular or Text Links</h3>
    <p>The most common type of link is the text link. These are text that are usually rendered                 
    underlined and in blue, and allows you to visit a linked resource. 
    To create a simple text link, use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag by following this syntax:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a href="URL of page you want to link to"&gt;link text&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    <p><strong>What does this syntax mean?</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag opens the link element.</li>
        <li>The href attribute will tell you the destination of the link.</li>
        <li>The "link text" could be anything from a simple description of the linked page to                
        something like "click here" or "visit the page."</li>
        <li>The <code>&lt;/a&gt;</code> tag closes the element.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google It!&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    <p><strong>Would show as:</strong></p>
    <p><a href="http://www.google.com">Google It!</a></p>
    <p>Clicking on that link will take you to http://www.google.com. Take note that the             
    destination URL does not have to be an HTML page or a Web page. Links could take                 
    you to an image file, a Word document, a PDF file, or even audio, video and other                 
    multimedia files.</p>
    <h3>Image Links</h3>
    <p>Sometimes, you would want to use an image instead of a text link. That is possible too.                 
    To use an image as your link, use the following syntax:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a href="URL"&gt;
    &lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="alt text of image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>On your page, the picture called image.jpg will be linked to any URL you have.</p>
    <h3>Links to eMail Addresses</h3>
    <p>Instead of an URL, image or video and other similar files, you could create an email                
    link. An email link would open the user's default email client (Gmail, Outlook, Apple              
    Mail, etc) and start a new message with the specified email addresses already filled              
    into the TO: field. If you have also specified a subject, the subject line will also be filled                  
    in automatically.</p>
    <p><strong>How do you do this? Use the following syntax:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a href="mailto:you@yourdomain.com?Subject=Creating an email link!"&gt; Send me an 
    email!&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>On your page, this will show up as 
    “Send me an email!”</p>
    <p>When you click on that link, it will open your email client to compose a new message                 
    window. On the TO field, you will see you@yourdomain.com already entered and the             
    subject line will read as "Creating an email link!".</p>
    <h3>Anchor Links</h3>
    <p>There are times when you need to create links to different parts of your document. For                
    example, FAQ pages usually have all the questions at the top of the page and then the                 
    answers to these questions follow below.</p>
    <p>A good way to create a link that would take your users to a specific spot of the same                    
    page is by creating anchor links. To do this, you must first create a bookmark using the                  
    "id" attribute.</p>
    <p><strong>For example, the answer to question number 10 is "10. Yes, we do handle that." Look                
    at your source code, find that corresponding line and just add the bookmark like this:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a id="AnswerTen"&gt;10. Yes, we do handle that.&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    <p><strong>At the top of your page, create a link to that bookmark, i.e.:</strong></p>
    <pre><code>&lt;a href="#AnswerTen"&gt;Question 10: Do you handle HTML tutorials?&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>On your page, Question 10 will be highlighted and when you click on it, it will take you                   
    directly to the bookmarked answer below. Do not forget to add the # sign before the                
    bookmark name when linking.</p>
    <h3>Other considerations when creating links:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Take note that you can specify where a linked resource would be opened. It could                
        be 
        <ul>
            <li>opened in the same page (default).</li>
            <li>opened in a new window, in which case you would need to add the              
            target="_blank" attribute to your link element.</li>
        </ul>
        If you are working with frames, there are also attributes that would allow you to specify                
        on which frame the link would open.
        <ul>
            <li>target="_self" would open the link in the same frame where you clicked it.</li>
            <li>target="_parent" would open the linked page in the parent frame.</li>
            <li>target="_xyz" would open the linked page in the frame named "xyz".</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Using absolute or relative URLs.</strong>
        Absolute URLs specify the full URL, i.e. http://www.you.com/me.html. This is usually           
        used when you are linking to another Web site on another domain.
        Relative URLs, on the other hand, will not have the domain part, but instead it will be                 
        written as me.html. This is usually used when you are linking to pages within your own                
        domain.</li>
    </ol>
